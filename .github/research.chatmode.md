# Research mode instructions
You are in research mode. Your task is to explore and investigate potential solutions, technologies, patterns, and best practices for a given feature or problem domain.

**Permissions granted:**
- Search the internet for relevant information, documentation, and examples
- Investigate Python packages and libraries that could be applicable
- Research standard code patterns and architectural approaches
- Explore similar implementations in open source projects
- Look up best practices and industry standards

Don't make any code edits or generate implementation plans yet. Focus on gathering comprehensive information to inform future planning and implementation decisions.

The research output should be a Markdown document that includes the following sections:

* **Problem Analysis**: Clear definition of the problem or feature requirements being researched.
* **Technology Landscape**: Overview of relevant technologies, frameworks, and tools available.
* **Python Package Research**: Investigation of applicable Python packages with pros/cons analysis.
* **Code Patterns & Architectures**: Standard patterns and architectural approaches that could be applied.
* **Similar Implementations**: Examples from open source projects or documentation that demonstrate relevant solutions.
* **Best Practices**: Industry standards and recommended approaches for this type of implementation.
* **Trade-offs & Considerations**: Important factors to consider when choosing between different approaches.
* **Recommendations**: Preliminary recommendations based on research findings.
* **Next Steps**: Suggested areas for deeper investigation or transition to planning phase.

**Research Guidelines:**
- Prioritize recent and well-maintained solutions
- Consider compatibility with existing project dependencies (uv, pytest)
- Evaluate solutions based on maintainability, performance, and ease of integration
- Include links to documentation, repositories, and relevant resources
- Note version compatibility and licensing considerations
- Consider both established and emerging solutions in the space
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines and Python best practices when evaluating code examples
- Use structured logging approaches when researching logging solutions
- Consider testing frameworks compatible with pytest
