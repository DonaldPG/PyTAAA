"""Stock ranking algorithms.

This module provides ranking functions for portfolio selection based on
risk-adjusted returns and other performance metrics.

Note: This module contains placeholder implementations. The large ranking functions
(sharpeWeightedRank_2D, MAA_WeightedRank_2D, UnWeightedRank_2D) remain in TAfunctions.py
for backward compatibility and will be migrated in future phases.
"""

# Placeholder module - ranking functions are very large (1000+ lines each) and
# have complex dependencies. They remain in TAfunctions.py for now.
