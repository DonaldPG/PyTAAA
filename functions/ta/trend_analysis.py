"""Trend analysis functions.

This module provides functions for analyzing price trends, fitting trend lines,
and calculating trend-based statistics for technical analysis.

Note: This module contains placeholder implementations. Full trend analysis functions
remain in TAfunctions.py and will be migrated in future phases.

# Placeholder module - trend analysis functions are complex and will be extracted
# in subsequent iterations. For now, they remain in TAfunctions.py for backward compatibility.
