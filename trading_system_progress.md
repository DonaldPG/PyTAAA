### Unified Monte Carlo Plotting System ðŸ†• **August 2025**

#### Problem Identified
The Monte Carlo backtesting system had approximately 120 lines of duplicated plotting code across multiple methods, creating:
- **Code Maintenance Issues**: Changes required in multiple locations
- **Inconsistent Formatting**: Different plot appearances across functions
- **Development Friction**: Difficult to implement consistent improvements
- **Testing Complexity**: Multiple plotting paths to validate

#### Solution Implemented
**Completed**: Full consolidation of plotting functionality into a single, enhanced `create_monte_carlo_plot()` method

1. **Code Consolidation**
   - Eliminated ~120 lines of duplicate plotting code
   - Single source of truth for all Monte Carlo plot generation
   - Unified function used by both `plot_performance()` and `run_monte_carlo.py`
   - Maintainable architecture for future enhancements

2. **Enhanced Plot Formatting**
   - **X-axis Grid Intervals**: 5-year major intervals, 1-year minor intervals
   - **Date Label Formatting**: Horizontal year-only labels (e.g., "2000", "2005")
   - **Consistent Grid Styling**: Major/minor grids match between upper and lower subplots
   - **Professional Appearance**: Reduced font sizes and improved spacing

3. **Model Ranking Integration**
   - **Table-Formatted Rankings**: Properly aligned model performance tables

4. **Technical Implementation Details**
   ```python
   # Example of enhanced formatting
   ranking_text += f"{i:>1}. {model:<13} {score:>7.3f}\n"
   
   # Monospace font for table alignment
   ax1.text(0.02, 0.95, full_text, fontfamily='monospace')
   
   # Consistent date formatting
   ax1.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.YearLocator(5))
   ax1.xaxis.set_major_formatter(mdates.DateFormatter('%Y'))
   ```

#### Benefits Achieved

### Permutation-Invariant Lookback Optimization (Completed August 2025)

#### Problem Identified
The original Monte Carlo system treated different orderings of the same lookback periods as distinct combinations. For example, `[50, 150, 250]` and `[250, 50, 150]` were tracked separately despite having identical performance characteristics, leading to:
- Inefficient memory usage with 6x redundancy for 3 lookbacks (3! = 6 permutations)
- Slower convergence to optimal parameters
- Diluted performance statistics across equivalent combinations

#### Solution Implemented
1. **Canonical Form System**
   - All lookback combinations stored in sorted order: `tuple(sorted(lookbacks))`
   - Dynamic mapping from canonical tuples to tracking indices
   - Automatic deduplication of equivalent permutations

2. **Enhanced Tracking Infrastructure**
   - Replaced fixed 3D arrays with flexible dictionaries and lists
   - `combination_indices: Dict[Tuple[int, ...], int]` maps canonical forms to indices
   - `canonical_performance_scores: List[float]` tracks running averages
   - `canonical_visit_counts: List[int]` tracks visit frequency

3. **Improved UCB1 Algorithm**
   - UCB1 operates on canonical combinations only
   - Exploration/exploitation balance maintained with proper statistics
   - All permutations contribute to same canonical performance estimate

4. **Duplicate Prevention System** ðŸ†• **August 2025**
   - Explicit duplicate checking in `_generate_diverse_lookbacks()` method
   - Retry mechanism with configurable attempts (default: 100) to find unique combinations
   - Prevents computational waste from testing identical parameter sets multiple times
   - Graceful fallback when parameter space approaches exhaustion
   - Comprehensive logging for duplicate detection and regeneration tracking

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - `get_permutation_statistics()` provides efficiency metrics
   - Logs theoretical vs actual combination counts
   - Tracks best performing canonical combinations
   - Reports efficiency improvement factor
   - Monitors duplicate detection frequency and retry patterns

#### Implementation Details
- **Memory Efficiency**: Dynamic storage scales with unique combinations discovered
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing interfaces preserved, improvements transparent
- **Type Safety**: Full type annotations with proper generic typing
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of canonical combination discovery and performance
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallbacks for edge cases and empty data

#### Technical Improvements
1. **Core Methods Added**:
   - `_get_canonical_lookbacks()`: Converts any order to sorted tuple
   - `_get_combination_index()`: Maps canonicals to array indices
   - `_update_tracking_arrays()`: Updates performance with running averages
   - `get_permutation_statistics()`: Comprehensive efficiency reporting

2. **Algorithm Enhancements**:
   - UCB1 exploration weight configurable for fine-tuning
   - Proper handling of empty data states
   - Running average updates for stable performance estimates
   - Consistent canonical form throughout system

#### Expected Benefits
- **6x Memory Efficiency**: For 3 lookbacks, eliminates 5/6 redundant tracking
- **Faster Convergence**: All permutations contribute to same canonical statistics
- **Better Performance Estimates**: More visits per canonical combination
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles arbitrary lookback counts without exponential growth

#### Validation and Testing

   uv run python run_monte_carlo.py
   
   # Pure exploration mode - maximum parameter space coverage
   uv run python run_monte_carlo.py --search explore
   
   # Pure exploitation mode - focus on best-performing combinations
   uv run python run_monte_carlo.py --search exploit
   
   # Explicit dynamic mode - programmatic transition
